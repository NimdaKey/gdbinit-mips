This is a gdbinit file to make gdb more functional and useful when debugging
programs running on a MIPS cpu.

I have shamelessly aped this from http://reverse.put.as/gdbinit/ which can be
checked out from https://github.com/gdbinit. Much thanks to @osxreverser for an
excellent x86/x86-64/ARM gdbinit file.

I have used this gdbinit extensively on MIPS little endian, but only briefly on
MIPS big endian.  There may be endianness implications I haven't considered.

You can use it by either making it your ~/.gdbinit (probably not ideal if you
ever debug non-mips) or by doing:

gdb -x ./gdbinit-mips
